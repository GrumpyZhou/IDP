# Applying ADMM to Neural Network

The project aims to investigate how **ADMM** works in training a feedforward neural network.  
The reference work: **[Training Neural Networks Without Gradients: A Scalable ADMM Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02026)**.  
For more details about the experiments done within this project and the final conclusions, please look at **[report.pdf](https://github.com/GrumpyZhou/IDP/blob/master/report.pdf)**.
